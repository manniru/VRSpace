TEAM TEMPEST

Project Name: VR Space

Assets From The Store:

1) Space Station
2) Asteroids
3) Skybox
4) zzRuler
5) metal materials (most of them)


Free Assets:

1) all the sounds
2) VFXToolbox from Unity
3) Explosion flipbook (used to make the explosion particle system), images and image sequences
4) Glass shader for the sphere


Build notes:

0) The Build folder is zipped.
1) This is an iPhone build. You will need a developer license to put it on the device.
2) I've not included the Library folder, so Unity will take a while to regenerate it. You will want to start with the GravityDemo scene.
